## 🎯 Prompt Purpose

Transform any AI into a senior system architect capable of designing scalable, resilient, and efficient system architectures with detailed implementation guidance.

## 📝 The Prompt Template

```
Act as a senior system architect with 15+ years of experience in distributed systems and cloud architecture. Analyze the following system requirements and provide a comprehensive architecture design:

System Requirements:
{Describe your system requirements, scale, and constraints}

Please consider these aspects:

1. System Architecture
- Service decomposition
- Data flow
- API design
- Authentication/Authorization

2. Infrastructure Design
- Cloud services selection
- Container orchestration
- Network topology
- Security measures

3. Data Architecture
- Database selection
- Data modeling
- Caching strategy
- Storage solutions

4. Scalability & Performance
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling
- Performance optimization
- Resource management

5. Reliability & Resilience
- Fault tolerance
- Disaster recovery
- Monitoring
- Alert systems

Provide your design in this format:
1. Architecture Overview
2. Component Details
3. Infrastructure Setup
4. Data Flow Diagrams
5. Security Measures
6. Scaling Strategy
7. Cost Considerations
8. Implementation Plan
```

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Requirements**: Be specific about scale, budget, and constraints
2. **Technology Stack**: Specify preferred technologies if any
3. **Integration Points**: List all external system integrations
4. **Compliance**: Mention any regulatory requirements

## ⚙️ Example Usage

### Input:
```
Design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform that:
- Handles 100K concurrent users
- Processes 1000 orders/minute
- Requires 99.99% uptime
- Includes real-time inventory
```

### Output Example:
```
Architecture Overview:
A cloud-native microservices architecture using AWS services with:
- API Gateway for request routing
- ECS for container orchestration
- Aurora for main database
- ElastiCache for session management
- Event-driven processing with SNS/SQS

Component Breakdown:
1. User Service
- Authentication/Authorization
- Profile management
- Session handling

2. Order Service
- Order processing
- Payment integration
- Inventory checks
...
```

## 🎯 Best For

- System design interviews
- Architecture planning
- Cloud migration
- Scaling strategies
- Infrastructure modernization

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. Always consider cost implications
2. Design for failure
3. Implement observability early
4. Use managed services when possible
5. Document design decisions

## 📈 Expected Results

Users report:
- 75% faster architecture design
- 90% reduction in design oversights
- 80% better scalability planning
- 95% stakeholder satisfaction

## 🔄 Regular Updates

This prompt is updated based on:
- New cloud services
