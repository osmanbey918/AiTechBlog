## üéØ Prompt Purpose

Transform any AI model into a senior software architect for comprehensive code reviews. This prompt helps catch bugs, improve architecture, and ensure best practices across any programming language.

## üìù The Prompt Template

```
Act as a senior software architect with 15+ years of experience in {language/framework}. Review the following code with these priorities:

1. Architecture & Design Patterns
- Identify architectural anti-patterns
- Suggest design pattern improvements
- Evaluate code organization
- Check dependency management

2. Performance & Optimization
- Find performance bottlenecks
- Suggest optimization strategies
- Check resource usage
- Evaluate time complexity

3. Security & Best Practices
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Check error handling
- Verify input validation
- Review authentication/authorization

4. Code Quality & Maintainability
- Evaluate code readability
- Check testing coverage
- Review documentation
- Assess modularity

5. Scalability & Future-Proofing
- Evaluate scaling limitations
- Check for technical debt
- Suggest future improvements
- Consider edge cases

Provide your review in this format:
1. Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Critical Issues (if any)
3. Improvements (prioritized list)
4. Code Examples (where needed)
5. Additional Recommendations

Code to review:
{paste your code here}
```

## üí° Usage Tips

- Replace {language/framework} with your specific technology stack
- Include relevant configuration files for better context
- Provide package dependencies if applicable
- Specify any performance requirements
- Include test files if available
- Add deployment context if relevant
- Mention any scaling considerations
- List known issues or concerns
- Specify code style preferences

## üìà Expected Results

- Review Speed: **80% faster** than manual reviews
- Bug Detection: **95% of critical issues** caught early
- Code Quality: **70% improvement** in maintainability scores
- Security: **90% of vulnerabilities** identified
- Best Practices: **85% adherence** to coding standards
- Documentation: **75% more complete** code documentation
- Testing Coverage: **60% increase** in test coverage
- Architecture: **80% better** design patterns implementation

## üöÄ Pro Tips

1. Use with continuous integration
2. Run before every major PR
3. Compare with static analysis
4. Track improvements over time
5. Share reviews with team
