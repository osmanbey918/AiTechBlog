# *What Is Agentic AI?*

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that actively **plan, decide, and act independently**, far beyond reactive chatbots. Gartner named it a *top tech trend for 2025*, forecasting **33% of enterprise apps** will include autonomous agents by 2028 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Why It Matters

- **Autonomous workflows**: Agents can independently manage tasks like scheduling, inventory, or customer queries.
- **Efficiency gains**: Gartner expects these systems to reduce operational costs significantly :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Governance challenges**: Over **40% of agentic AI projects** may be scrapped by 2027 due to unclear ROI or lack of oversight :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
